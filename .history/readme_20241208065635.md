# Next JS Interview Questions

### **1. Basics of Next.js**

<details>
<summary><strong>1. What is Next.js?</strong></summary>
Next.js is a <strong>React-based full stack Framework </strong> that simplifies building modern web applications. It enhances React by providing additional features, tools, and optimizations. Here’s a breakdown in simple terms:

### Key Features of Next.js:
1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** 
   - Pages can be rendered on the server before being sent to the browser.
   - Improves SEO and load times because search engines and users receive fully formed pages.

2. **Static Site Generation (SSG):**
   - Pages can be pre-generated at build time and served as static files.
   - This makes the app super fast and scalable for pages that don’t change often.

3. **API Routes:**
   - You can create backend-like API endpoints directly in the Next.js project without needing a separate backend server.
   - Example: `pages/api/hello.js` can serve as an API endpoint.

4. **Dynamic Routing:**
   - Create routes with parameters like `/products/[id]` for dynamic pages.
   - No need to manually configure routes; they’re inferred from the file structure.

5. **Built-in CSS and Image Optimization:**
   - Supports CSS modules, Sass, and built-in image optimization for faster loading.
   - Helps deliver optimized images in various formats and sizes automatically.

6. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):**
   - Allows updating static pages after the build process without rebuilding the entire app.
   - Useful for apps with content that changes periodically.

7. **File-Based Routing:**
   - The folder structure in the `pages` directory directly maps to application routes.
   - No need to configure routing manually.

8. **Automatic Code Splitting:**
   - Loads only the JavaScript required for a particular page, improving performance.

9. **Full-stack Capabilities:**
   - Combines frontend and backend features, making it easier to handle data fetching and server-side logic.

10. **Edge-Ready:**
   - Supports edge rendering for low-latency, region-based deployments (like Vercel’s Edge Network).

<summary><strong>2. Why is Next.js Popular?</strong></summary>
- **SEO Friendly:** Pre-rendering ensures search engines can easily crawl pages.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Built-in tools simplify common tasks.
- **Scalable and Flexible:** Works well for small apps and large-scale projects.
- **Community Support:** Actively maintained by Vercel with a large ecosystem of plugins and extensions.
</details>



### When to Use Next.js?
- When your app needs **good SEO** (e.g., blogs, e-commerce, portfolios).
- When you want **fast performance** with static/dynamic rendering.
- When you prefer to keep frontend and backend logic in the same codebase.
- For **React projects** that need advanced features out of the box.

3. **What is the difference between React and Next.js?**
   - React is a library for building UIs; Next.js is a framework built on React that adds server-side rendering, static site generation, and file-based routing.
---

4. **How is routing handled in Next.js?**
   - File-based routing: The folder structure inside the `pages/` directory defines routes.
---

5. **What is the purpose of the `pages` directory in Next.js?**
   - It contains React components mapped to specific routes based on the file structure.

---

### **2. Rendering Techniques**

6. **What is server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js?**
   - A page is rendered on the server for each request, sending HTML to the browser.
   - Implemented using `getServerSideProps`.

---

7. **What is static site generation (SSG) in Next.js?**
   - Pages are pre-rendered at build time and served as static files.
   - Implemented using `getStaticProps`.

---

8. **What is client-side rendering (CSR)?**
   - Pages are rendered entirely on the client using React, typically for dynamic data fetching.

---

9. **What is incremental static regeneration (ISR)?**
   - Allows static pages to be updated incrementally without rebuilding the entire site.
   - Implemented with `revalidate` in `getStaticProps`.

---

10. **What is the difference between SSR and SSG in Next.js?**
    - SSR generates HTML on every request; SSG generates it at build time.

---

### **3. Data Fetching**

11. **What is `getStaticProps` in Next.js?**
    - Fetches data at build time for SSG.
    ```javascript
    export async function getStaticProps() {
      return { props: { data: 'Static Data' } };
    }
    ```
---

12. **What is `getServerSideProps` in Next.js?**
    - Fetches data at request time for SSR.
    ```javascript
    export async function getServerSideProps() {
      return { props: { data: 'Server Data' } };
    }
    ```
---

13. **What is `getStaticPaths`?**
    - Used with `getStaticProps` to define dynamic routes for static generation.
    ```javascript
    export async function getStaticPaths() {
      return { paths: [{ params: { id: '1' } }], fallback: false };
    }
    ```
---

14. **What is the `fallback` key in `getStaticPaths`?**
    - Determines behavior for routes not generated at build time.
      - `false`: 404 for non-pre-rendered pages.
      - `true`: Pages are generated on demand.

15. **Can you use client-side data fetching in Next.js?**
    - Yes, with React hooks like `useEffect` and `fetch`.

---

### **4. Routing and Navigation**

16. **How does dynamic routing work in Next.js?**
    - Use brackets in file names, e.g., `[id].js` for `/post/1`.
---

17. **How do you navigate between pages in Next.js?**
    - Use the `Link` component.
    ```javascript
    import Link from 'next/link';
    <Link href="/about">About</Link>
    ```
---

18. **What is shallow routing?**
    - Allows you to update the URL without triggering a full page reload or data fetching.
---

19. **How do API routes work in Next.js?**
    - Define API routes in the `pages/api/` directory. Each file exports a handler function.
    ```javascript
    export default function handler(req, res) {
      res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello World' });
    }
    ```
---

20. **How do you handle custom routes in Next.js?**
    - Use the `next.config.js` file for rewrites or redirects.
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      async rewrites() {
        return [{ source: '/custom', destination: '/about' }];
      },
    };
    ```

---

### **5. Performance Optimization**

21. **What is code splitting in Next.js?**
    - Automatically splits code to load only the JavaScript required for the page.
---
22. **How does Next.js optimize images?**
    - Use the `next/image` component for lazy loading, resizing, and optimizing images.
    ```javascript
    import Image from 'next/image';
    <Image src="/image.png" width={500} height={500} />;
    ```
---
23. **What is `next/script`?**
    - Optimizes loading of third-party scripts with features like lazy loading and priority.
---
24. **How can you optimize font loading in Next.js?**
    - Use the `next/font` module for automatic font optimization.
---
25. **How does prefetching work in Next.js?**
    - Automatically prefetches linked pages when they are visible in the viewport.

---

---
28. **How do you deploy a Next.js app?**
    - Deploy on platforms like Vercel (recommended), AWS, or Netlify.

---
29. **What is the difference between `publicRuntimeConfig` and `serverRuntimeConfig`?**
    - `publicRuntimeConfig`: Accessible on both client and server.
    - `serverRuntimeConfig`: Accessible only on the server.

---
30. **How do you enable TypeScript in Next.js?**
    - Add a `tsconfig.json` file. Next.js automatically detects and compiles TypeScript.

    - A React hook for client-side data fetching with caching and revalidation.

---
34. **How do you handle CORS in Next.js API routes?**
    - Use middleware or libraries like `cors`.

---
35. **What is the `res.revalidate` method in Next.js?**
    - Triggers a re-build of static pages.

---

### **8. Styling**

36. **How do you style components in Next.js?**
    - Use CSS, Sass, CSS Modules, or styled-components.
